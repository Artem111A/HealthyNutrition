If you do not have enough proteins then you would face the issue of weakness and fatigue. This is because proteins are also used by your muscles to restore their energy . This means that eating food high in&nbsp; protein is even more important for athletes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
